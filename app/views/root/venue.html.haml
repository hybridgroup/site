  If you are flying to Southern California to attend the conference we recommend flying into Bob Hope International Airport in Burbank.  It is located less than five miles from the venue.  If you fly into LAX then we recommend catching an express shuttle from the airport to the hotel, a cab ride will cost $85.00 or more depending on traffic.
